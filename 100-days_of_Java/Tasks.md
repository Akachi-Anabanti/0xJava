4. Write a program that creates an array of `Shape` objects (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) and calculates the total area of all the shapes.
5. Develop a `BankingSystem` class that manages a collection of `BankAccount` objects. Implement methods to open new accounts, deposit/withdraw funds, and generate account statements.

**Real-World Tasks:**
1. Design and implement a simple inventory management system for a small retail store, including classes for `Product`, `Inventory`, and `Order`.

5. Develop a `TodoList` application that uses a `HashMap` to store and manage todo items, with methods to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

**Real-World Tasks:**
1. Implement a file backup utility that can automatically backup specified directories to a remote location (e.g., cloud storage).

3. Develop a scheduling application that can manage a list of events with start/end times and notify users of upcoming events.
4. Implement a multi-threaded web crawler that can concurrently download and process web pages.
5. Create a utility that can encrypt and decrypt files using the Java Cryptography API.

5. Implement a web-based project management tool with features for task assignment, project tracking, and team collaboration.

**Startup MVP-Worthy Projects:**
1. Build a web-based personal finance management tool that allows users to track their income, expenses, and investments.
2. Develop a web-based platform for freelancers to find and bid on projects, manage their portfolios, and invoice clients.
