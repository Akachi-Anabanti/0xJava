# 100 Days of Java: From Beginner to Advanced

Welcome to my 100-day journey of learning Java, from the basics to advanced topics.
This plan will guide yme through mastering the core functions of Java and building web, mobile, and desktop applications.

## Overview

This learning plan is divided into the following sections:

1. Foundations (Days 1-20)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (Days 21-40)
3. Java Standard Library (Days 41-60)
4. Java Web Development (Days 61-80)
5. Java Mobile and Desktop Applications (Days 81-100)

Each section builds upon the previous one, allowing me to gradually develop a comprehensive understanding of Java programming.
